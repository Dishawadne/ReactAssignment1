# React Assignment

This React application demonstrates the use of both function and class components, passing props between components, and handling state with input fields and button events.

## Components

### Function Components

The application includes four function components: `First`, `Second`, `Third`, and `Fourth`.

### Class Components

The application also includes four class components: `First1`, `Second1`, `Third1`, and `Fourth1`.

### Student Component

A `Student` component is used to display `name`, `address`, and `scores` passed from the `App` component. This is done using both function and class components.

### Display Component

A `Display` component receives `name` and `address` as props from the `App` component. These are displayed in text boxes and can be modified within the component.

## Event Handling

Two buttons are added with `onClick` events to display alerts with messages "Hello" and "Bye".
